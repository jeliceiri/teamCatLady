# The Team Enterprise Java Project

This repository is the team project for the final Java course at Madison College in the Fall 2021. The team members are: Jenn Mann, Jill Eliceiri, and Kristin Racchini. The project simulates a real world application where all team members contribute to a web service built using Java.
## Problem Statement
An important piece of our country's history are the individuals who have served as the US President. Many types of audiences both in general public and in education settings routinely look for information about the presidents. Examples include a student looking up biography information on a president for history class term paper or someone checking a presidential fact as they play a trivia game.  Currently, information regarding the US Presidents can be found on various personal and official government websites each with varying degrees of information . This service provides a unified way to access complete information about US Presidents in a single web portal.
