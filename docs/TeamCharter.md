# Team Cat Lady Charter 

### Team Members
Jill Eliceiri, Jen Mann, Kristin Racchini 

### Team Goal 
To create an API that meets or exceeds all outlined requirements by the deadline 

### Team Meetings 
We will meet on Tuesdays at 6:15 with an optional check in later in the week or on the weekend. Outside of these meetings, communication will be done via Slack. 

### The following are rules that we all agree to abide by during the course of our team project:
* Assume positive intentions from team members 
* Communicate any issues or conflicts with other members of the team as soon as possible 
* Treat team members with respect 
* Focus on constructive feedback 
* Any disagreements will be solved with a vote - majority rules (no fillibusters)
* Accomplish tasks by the agreed-upon deadline 
* Express disagreements professionally and tactfully
